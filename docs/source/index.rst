typevalidation for Python functions and classes
===============================================

Developing libraries have always the problem, that given parameters
need to be of special types or have special contraints. Normally one
would write a conversion routine inside a function or class member,
but this library offers the possibility to do the conversion
automatically with python decorators and annotations.
